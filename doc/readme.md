This document provides the steps to build the HexWatershed model.

It is possible to build and run the HexWatershed on Linux/Mac/Windows if your system meets the requirements:
* GCC 5.2.0 and above
* GDAL 2.3.1 

In this instruction, I only use a Linux machine as an example. For other platform, you need to adjust several files. 

Figures provided to illustrate the steps when needed.

* In the terminal, create a folder for this project
* Clone the repository into the folder with "git clone git@github.com:pnnl/hexwatershed.git"
