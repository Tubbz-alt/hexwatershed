# HexWatershed

HexWatershed is a hydrologic routing model based on the hexagon mesh framework.

# Compile
1. git clone git@github.com:pnnl/hexwatershed.git
2. Navigate to the directory which has the CMakeLists.txt file
3. Adjust your configuration of the CMakeLists.txt
4. cmake CMakeLists.txt
5. make

# Usage
In order to run the program, you need to prepare a few input files:
1. A hexagon grid
2. A DEM
