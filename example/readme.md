# Overview
This document provides the instruction to run a HexWatershed model simulation.

# Data structure

HexWatershed uses a text based file as model input.
Within this text file, each line represents a model configuration.
An example of such a text file is provided here: https://github.com/pnnl/hexwatershed/tree/master/example/columbia_basin_flat/input/cbf.meta

The content of this text file is as follow:
![Model input](https://github.com/pnnl/hexwatershed/blob/master/example/figure/cbfmeta.png?raw=true)

At each line, the configuration is separated by a comma ",".
